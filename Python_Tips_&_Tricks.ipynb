My objective today is to teach you something that makes you say \"Oh Neat!\" or something like that. And if you do know everything, well that's good on you! We will be covering what some might refer to as syntactical sugar to make you a certified Pythonista (unofficially). We will end with some more intermediate concepts that may make you scratch your head. Don't worry though, that itch will go away.. eventually. \n",
